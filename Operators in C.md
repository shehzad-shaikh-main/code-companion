In C language, operators are symbols that represent operations to be performed on one or more operands. They are the basic components of the C programming. In this article, we will learn about all the built-in operators in C with examples.

## What is a C Operator?
An operator in C can be defined as the symbol that helps us to perform some specific mathematical, relational, bitwise, conditional, or logical computations on values and variables. The values and variables used with operators are called operands. So we can say that the operators are the symbols that perform operations on operands.

For example,

```
c = a + b;
```

Here, ‘+’ is the operator known as the addition operator, and ‘a’ and ‘b’ are operands. The addition operator tells the compiler to add both of the operands ‘a’ and ‘b’.

## Types of Operators in C
C language provides a wide range of operators that can be classified into 6 types based on their functionality:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Other Operators

1. Arithmetic Operations in C
The arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. There are 9 arithmetic operators in C language:

| S. No. | Symbol | Operator | Description              | Syntax |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------ | ------ |
| 1      | +      | Plus     | Adds two numeric values. | a + b  |
| 2      | -      | Minus    | Subtracts right operand from left operand. | a – b |
|3|*|Multiply|Multiply two numeric values.|a * b|
|4|/|Divide|Divide two numeric values.|a / b|
|5|%|Modulus|Returns the remainder after diving the left operand with the right operand.|a % b|
|6|+|Unary Plus|Used to specify the positive values.|+a|
|7|–|Unary Minus|Flips the sign of the value.|-a|
|8|++|Increment|Increases the value of the operand by 1.|a++|
|9|—

Decrement

Decreases the value of the operand by 1.
