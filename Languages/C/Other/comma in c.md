In C, comma ( , ) can be used in three contexts:

1. **Comma as an operator**
2. **Comma as a separator**
3. **Comma operator in place of a semicolon**
# 1. Comma as an Operator
A comma operator in C++ is a binary operator. It evaluates the first operand & discards the result, evaluates the second operand & returns the value as a result. It has the lowest precedence among all C++ Operators. It is left-associative & acts as a sequence point.
