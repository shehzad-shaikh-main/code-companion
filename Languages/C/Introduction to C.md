**C** is a procedural programming language initially developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in the year **1972** at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the **UNIX operating system***

**The main features of the C language include:**

- General Purpose and Portable
- Low-level Memory Access
- Fast Speed
- Clean Syntax

These features make the C language suitable for system programming like an operating system or compiler development.

## Why Should We Learn C?

Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language like the syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages that are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

So,  if a person learns C programming first, it will help them to learn any modern programming language as well. Also, learning C helps to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating system like pointers, working with memory locations, etc.

## Difference Between C and C++

C++ was created to add the OOPs concept into the C language so they both have very similar syntax with a few differences. The following are some of the main differences between C and C++ Programming languages.

- C++ supports OOPs paradigm while C only has the procedural concept of programming.
- C++ has exception handling capabilities. In C, we have to resolve exceptions manually.
- There are no references in C.
