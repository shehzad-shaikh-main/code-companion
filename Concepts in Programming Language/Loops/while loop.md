## while Loop

While studying for loop, we have seen that the number of iterations is ****known beforehand**** , i.e. the number of times the loop body is needed to be executed is known to us. while loop is used in situations where we do not know the exact number of iterations of the loop beforehand. It is an entry-controlled loop whose execution is terminated on the basis of the test conditions.

[[While loop code Syntax]]

Only the ****condition**** is the part of while loop syntax, we have to do the ****initialization**** and ****updation**** manually outside and inside the loop respectively.
