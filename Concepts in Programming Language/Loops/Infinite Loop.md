## Infinite Loops

An ****infinite loop**** (sometimes called an endless loop ) is a piece of coding that lacks a ****functional exit**** so that it repeats indefinitely. An infinite loop occurs when a condition is always evaluated to be true. Usually, this is an error. We can manually create an infinite loop using all three loops:

### Using for loop
[[Infinite for loop code]]
Output: 
```Output
This loop will run forever.
This loop will run forever.
This loop will run forever.
..............
```

### Using while Loop
[[Infinite while loop code]]
Output:
```Output
This loop will run forever.
This loop will run forever.
This loop will run forever.
..............
```
### Using do while Loop
[[Infinite do while loop code]]
Output
```Output
This loop will run forever.
This loop will run forever.
This loop will run forever.
..............
```
