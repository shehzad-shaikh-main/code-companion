## do while Loop
 The **do-while loop** is also a loop whose execution is terminated on the basis of test conditions. The main difference between a do-while loop and the while loop is in the do-while loop the condition is tested at the end of the loop body, i.e. do-while loop is exit controlled whereas the other two loops are entry-controlled loops. So, in a do-while loop, the loop body will _****execute at least once****_ irrespective of the test condition.
Syntax:

Like while loop, only the ****condition**** is the part of do while loop syntax, we have to do the ****initialization**** and ****updation**** manually outside and inside the loop respectively.
