Sometimes, there is a need perform some operation more than once or say **n** number of times. For example, suppose we want to print "Hello World" 5 times. WE would have to write it manually in our language

```pseudocode
print "Hello World\n"
print "Hello World\n"
print "Hello World\n"
print "Hello World\n"
print "Hello World\n"
```
The output would be:
```Output
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
```

But what if we have to print it 20 times, 50 times or 1000 times? We won't have all day to do this. In this case, instead of writing it manually, we would instruct our computer to do this repeated task using **loops**.

## What are loops?
Loop is an instruction that is used to repeatedly execute a code until a certain condition is met.

There are two types of loops:
1. **Entry controlled loops**
2. **Exit controlled loops**

In entry controlled loops, the condition is first checked before the block of code is executed.
In an exit controlled loop, first the block of code is executed and then the condition is checked. This is greatly useful in menu driven applications and games where we need to see some output.

Types of loops:
![[For Loop]]
![[while loop]]
![[do while loop]]
